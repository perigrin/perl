=head1 REVISION HISTORY FOR Set::Object

=head1 1.28, 22 Jul 2010

=over

=item *

Fixed a portability concern for some platforms' C compilers (that do
not support //-style comments) - RT#52690

=item *

Valid SIGNATURE file - RT#50492

=back

=head1 1.27, 15 Jan 2009

=over

=item *

Fix a typo that affected building against Perls with debugging enabled.

=item *

A minor #define refactor (Yuval).

=item *

Squash some long-standing warnings I had been ignoring for ages and
Havard Eidnes prompted me to fix by logging an RT ticket for it.

=item *

Squash some global clean-up warnings.

=back

=head1 1.26, 13 Oct 2008

=over

=item *

Methods which destroyed C<$@> due to internal use of C<eval> now
properly call C<local($@)> (Yuval)

=item *

Fix a leak and a corner case with weak set magic, and squash some
warnings (Yuval)

=item *

Define behaviour when dealing with return values from operations on
weak sets.  No longer hard-coded "Set::Object" - may affect
Set::Object sub-classes (Sam).

=item *

(post-release changelog entry) related to the previous change,
Set::Object::Weak::set did not use to shift the invocant off the
stack, which caused result sets to have the inserted sets as members.
It now does, fixing this bug.

=back

=head1 1.25, 22 Jul 2008

=over

=item *

Portability: support Perls before 5.7.3, and make this dependency
explicit in the F<Makefile.PL>

=back

=head1 1.24, 20 Jul 2008

=over

=item *

Remove threads test which had inadvertantly slipped into the MANIFEST
from source control, and add comprehensive documentation on the state
of thread support in this module.

=item *

Correct other silly MANIFEST mistakes.

=back

=head1 1.23, 18 Jul 2008

=over

=item *

Make behaviour when dealing with items which were C<undef> defined.
Previously it might segfault (or Bus Error on Mac OS X) on some
operations and Perl versions, or result in an empty string being
inserted.

=item *

Fix a minor compile problem on IRIX, reported by David Cantrell.

=back

=head1 1.22, 8 Oct 2007

=over

=item *

Sub-classing interface added; it is now much easier to make
L<Set::Object> subclasses that return objects other than more
L<Set::Object>s when subclassing.  From Brían Mach Aon Innéirghthe.

=back

=head1 1.21, 17 Feb 2007

=over

=item *

Fix false negative when Test::Pod::Coverage isn't installed.  Reported
by Anna Bernathova of SuSE.

=back

=head1 1.20, 16 Feb 2007

=over

=item *

The C<-E<gt>compare> function was returning "disjoint" for empty sets.
RT#24965.  (Nigel Metheringham)

=item *

Document lots of methods that were previously not documented.

=item *

Fix C<Set::Object::Weak::set()>.  It was not passing its arguments to
C<Set::Object::Weak-E<gt>new()>, which was very broken.

=back

=head1 1.19, 23 Jan 2007

=over

=item *

remove bogus inclusions of Data::Dumper and Devel::Peek

=item *

New class C<Set::Object::Weak>, which all weak sets should get
re-blessed into when you call C<-E<gt>weaken>.  Also added alternative
methods of constructing weak sets.

=item *

Fix a memory leak with scalar members (the internal hash used to store
the items was never being freed).  RT#24508.

=back

=head1 1.18, 14 Sep 2006

=over

=item *

We could only build on gcc due to the use of variadic macros.
use C<#ifdef> to hide this GCC-specific extension (used only for
debugging) from non-GCC compilers.

=item *

Add note to man page on compatibility of C<Storable> serializations of
C<Set::Object>s between revisions.

=back

=head1 1.17, 1 Aug 2006

=item *

fix compile problem affecting some platforms

=back

=head1 1.16, 18 Jul 2006

=item *

weak reference support

=back

=head1 1.15, 21 Jun 2006

=item *

Dumping sets with scalars in them via L<Storable> now works.

=back

=head1 1.14

=over

=item *

Fix build problem on Win32 (thanks Steffen Goeldner)

=back

=head1 1.13

=over

=item *

Fix F<Makefile.PL> so this F<Changes.pod> is not delivered as
C<Set::Changes> :-}

=item *

Restore compatibility with 5.6.0

=item *

Remove some compile-time warnings, please let me know if this version
does not build on any platform!

=back

=head1 1.12, 30 Aug 2005

=over

=item *

added patch from Sergey Skvortsov for backwards compatibility with
Perl versions before 5.8 (include >100k F<ppport.h>!)

=item *

removed 'C<set()>' constructor from default export list, as its name
conflicts with too many other modules.

=back

=head1 1.11, 27 Apr 2005

=over

=item *

removed debugging C<&_> func (was causing strange errors on 5.9.1)

=cut

=back

=head1 1.10, 2 Apr 2005


=over

=item *

added 'C<set()>' constructor and use-as-array-ref interface

=back

=head1 1.09, 26 Mar 2005

=over

=item *

added 'bool' overload operator to C<Set::Object>.  For backwards
compatibility, always returns true.

=back

=head2 1.08_02, 14 Jan 2005

=over

=item *

Cutting out the "Universe" representation; this module gives plain
sets only.

=item *

documentation fixes

=back

=head2 1.08_01, 12 Jan 2005

=over

=item *

First attempt at adding support for scalars.  This version tries to
work as closely to C<Set::Scalar> as possible.

This approach will not be continued unless there are a lot of requests
for it to be implemented.  I think it's overly complicated, and not
what people expect when they want a Set.

=back

=head1 1.08, 14 Oct 2004

=over

=item *

another segfault bites the dust; this time, avoids a segfault when
taking a difference between sets of exactly 31 and 0 size.  Same root
fault as the previous bug, this time I have a test case for it, too.

=back

=head1 1.07, 16 Aug 2004

=over

=item *

yet another segfault fix, this time due to incorrect use of PUSHs vs
XPUSHs.  There is no test case for this bug unfortunately.

=back

=head1 1.06, 1 May 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed segfault when attempting to remove items from an empty set (fix
from Richard Sterling Cox)

=back

=head1 1.05, 5 Jan 2004

=over

=item *

some segfault fixes with Storable and Perl 5.6.1 (Perl 5.8.1 should be
OK)

=back

=head1 1.04, 3 Aug 2003

=over

=item *

added various functions similar to some found in Scalar::Util, but
with an extra one that performs a function that lays some groundwork
for L<Container::Object> (C<ish_int>).

Some of these functions were in the XS code anyway, and they are
extremely small, so I didn't see a problem with duplicating them -
saves an extra dependancy.  Plus, Graham Barr won't let me put
C<ish_int> or C<is_key> in his module.

Knowing that they are available will also assist in fixing some longer
standing bugs in Tangram (eg, using C<$obj + 0> to get a unique ID
when C<refaddr($obj)> would be better)

=item *

lots more input marshalling; if you ever end up doing funny things to
a C<Set::Object>, then at least now you'll get a clearer error
message.

=item *

more tests; L<Devel::Cover> test coverage now at 91% (stmt), 67% (branch)

=item *

erroneously putting scalars into C<Set::Object>s now no longer dumps
core.

=item *

serialisation of C<Set::Object> objects is now possible via the
L<Storable> module (L<Data::Dumper> still does the wrong thing, but
there is nothing I can do about that).

=back

=head1 1.03, 24 Jan 2003

=over

=item *

fixed overload related bug
