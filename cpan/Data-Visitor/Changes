0.27
    - Improve synopsis of Data::Visitor::Callback.
    - Remove the Test::MockObject dependency.

0.26
	- remove Any::Moose, one too many failures to subclass. When/if Mouse can be
	  subclassed by Moose we can consider putting it back

0.25
	- Depend on Any::Moose 0.09, which pulls in Mouse 0.21, avoiding warnings
	  related to compute_all_applicable_attributes (rafl)

0.24
	- use get_all_attributes instead of the deprecated
	  compute_all_applicable_attributes (rafl)

0.23
	- Switch to Any::Moose

0.22
	- add a no warnings 'recursion', deep recursion is legitimate in most cases

0.21
	- Fix a bug in Data::Visitor::Callback WRT returning non reference values
	  from callbacks (#38306).
	- Refactor the visit_tied split
	- Propagation of void context

0.20
	- Split visit_tied into methods per each reftype, to make it possible to
	  return something that is an object but still doesn't get tied.

0.19
	- Support multiple arguments to visit()
	- use BUILDARGS for argument processing
	- remove Data::Alias dep for now, it breaks on windows & aix with 5.8.8

0.18
	- Weak reference support

0.17
	- More void context correctness fixes WRT tied values
	- Overzealous seen value mappings made by Callback were removed

0.16
	- Fix passing of void context when visiting hashes/arrays (perf
	  optimization to avoid unnecessary cloning)
	- Added 'visit_seen' and a 'seen' callback for circular structures
	- Class callbacks are now fired from least derived to most derived, not in
	  hash key order

0.15
	- Fixed a compilation warning under 5.6.2
	- Disabled consistent replacement of values when assigning to $_ under
	  5.6.2 due to a limitation. 5.8 is required for that feature to work
	  properly. Instead, a warning will be issued and the value will be
	  revisited.

0.14
	- Refactored to use Tie::ToObject instead of a custom class
	- Simple tracing added, enable by setting $DEBUG
	- added the object_no_class callback
	- no longer uses $string->can("isa") to figure out if that's a class

0.13
	- Add support for preserving tied()ness, and for visiting

0.12
	- _register_mapping was not called for each class callback result

0.11
	- Fix a bug where objects were mapped to undef when a class callback
	  doesn't match

0.10
	- Fix buggy behavior for duplicate and circular values

0.09
	- add visit_hash_entry and visit_array_entry

0.08
	- add retain_magic and use it to keep blessedness of mapped objects that
	  were forced into being visited by "regular" ref visitor methods

0.07
	- Refactor visit_ref

0.06
	- Removed build_requires, to try and eliminate some odd installation
	  problems. This also fixes the Class::Accessor dep which was in the wrong
	  slot anyway ;-)

0.05
	- Added support for using class names as callbacks in
	  Data::Visitor::Callback
	- Improved semantics of multiple instances of the same reference in a depe
	  structure (will be mapped once, same mapped value used per each instance)

0.04
	- Specified that the Test::MockObject dep need 1.04

0.03
	- add Class::Accessor to requirements

0.02
	- Added GLOB recursion support
	- Added support for circular references
	_ Added aliasing to $_ to Data::Visitor::Callback
	- Added ignore_return_values to Data::Visitor::Callback

0.01
	- Initial release
