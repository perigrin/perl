autobox version 2.75
====================

The autobox pragma allows methods to be called on integers, floats, strings, arrays,
hashes, and code references in exactly the same manner as blessed references.

The autoboxing is transparent: boxed values are not blessed into their (user-defined)
implementation class (unless the method elects to bestow such a blessing) - they simply
use its methods as though they are.

autobox is lexically scoped, and bindings for an outer scope
can be overridden or countermanded in a nested scope.

See the POD for more details.
